GSE116106	SRP151023	The development of single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed high resolution analysis of cell type diversity and transcriptional networks controlling cell fate specification. To identify the transcriptional networks governing human retinal development, we performed scRNA-Seq over retinal organoid and in vivo retinal development, across 20 timepoints. Using both pseudotemporal and cross-species analyses, we examined the conservation of gene expression across retinal progenitor maturation and specification of all seven major retinal cell types. Furthermore, we examined gene expression differences between developing macula and periphery and between two distinct populations of horizontal cells. We also identify both shared and species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development. Finally, we identify an unexpected role for ATOH7 expression in regulation of photoreceptor specification during late retinogenesis. These results provide a roadmap to future studies of human retinal development, and may help guide the design of cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.	More than 45000 single cells from the developing human retina, ranging from gestational weeks (GW)12-27, and postnatal retina on day 8 were analyzed via single cell RNA-sequencing.

GSE121707	SRP166660	Müller glial cells (MGs) of the zebrafish retina exhibit the remarkable ability to reprogram to proliferative, retinal progenitor-like cells that can regenerate lost photoreceptors and restore vision. Unfortunately, mammalian MGs are not regenerative and this is at least in part due to the inability of MGs to undergo sustained cell cycle re-entry in response to retinal damage. Here, we identify the Hippo pathway as the core regulatory mechanism that normally prevents mammalian MG reprogramming to a proliferative, progenitor-like state. Specifically, in adult MGs within the damaged retina, Hippo signaling represses the activity of the transcription cofactor YAP, which would otherwise promote sustained MG cell cycle re-entry. MG-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components Lats1 and Lats2 resulted in Cyclin D1 upregulation and spontaneous MG proliferation. These data suggest that sustained YAP activity in reactive MGs induces MG proliferation and reprogramming, but this response is normally repressed by the Hippo pathway. Generation of MGs that express a variant of YAP (YAP5SA) that is non-responsive to Hippo signaling, resulted in cellular reprogramming whereby MG identity was lost and the cells acquired a highly proliferative, progenitor-like state.  Together, our results reveal that MGs may have latent regenerative capacity that can be “reawakened” by blocking Hippo signaling.

GSE119343	SRP159286	The macula of the retina has a high ratio of cones to rods and is critical for central vision and visual acuity. Here we report the generation, transcriptome profiling, and functional validation of single cells from cone-enriched human retinal organoids differentiated from hESCs.  Single-cell RNA-seq of 8-month retinal organoids identified clusters of cone and rod photoreceptors and confirmed the cone enrichment initially revealed by immunostaining. Collectively, we have established cone-enriched retinal organoids and a reference of transcriptomes that are rich resources for retinal studies.	To globally characterize the transcriptomes during human retinal cell differentiation, we performed single cell RNA sequencing  of 8M retinal organoids.	NA	NA
GSE112507	SRP136739	Death of photoreceptors and/or Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells is a common cause of age related and inherited retinal dystrophies, thus their replenishment from renewable stem cell sources is a well sought therapeutic goal. Human pluripotent stem cells provide a useful cell source in view of their limitless self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into all key retinal cell types either in isolation or as part of three dimensional retinal organoids. Photoreceptor precursors have been isolated from differentiating human pluripotent stem cells either through application of cell surface markers or fluorescent reporter approaches and shown to share a transcriptional profile akin to foetal photoreceptors. In this study we investigated the transcriptional profile of CRX+ photoreceptor precursors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) using single cell RNA sequencing and their engraftment capacity in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa (C3H/rd1). Single cell RNA seq analysis revealed the presence of dominant cell cluster which displayed the hallmarks of early cone photoreceptor expression. When transplanted subretinally into the C3H/rd1 mice, the Crx positive cells settled next to the inner nuclear layer of host retina, matured into cone photoreceptors and made connections with the inner neurones of the host retina. Cellular transfer between the host retina and donor photoreceptors was investigated and shown to be minimal. Together our data provide valuable molecular insights into the transcriptional profile of human pluripotent stem cells derived CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and indicate their usefulness as a source of transplantable cone photoreceptors.	CRX-GFP human ESC line was differentiated to retinal organoids. At day 90 CRX+ and CRX- cells were purified by flow activated cell sorting and subjected to single cell RNA-seq.

GSE126783	SRP186407	In many forms of retinal degenerative diseases in human, microglia relocate to and accumulate in the subretinal space. However, the roles of microglia in retinal degeneration are poorly understood. By leveraging single cell RNA-seq, we identified a distinct microglia subtype in the subretinal space. These microglia underwent transcriptional reprogramming characterized by reduced expression of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. Importantly, this transition is associated with protection of the retinal pigment epithelium from damage caused by disease. Therefore, our data demonstrated microglial heterogeneity in retinal degeneration and may provide important implications for developing new strategies to prevent loss of vision.

GSE119893	SRP161678	The rapid improvements in single cell sequencing technologies and analyses methods afford greater scope for dissecting organoid cultures composed of multiple cell types and create an opportunity to interrogate these models to understand tissue biology, cellular behaviour and interactions. To this end, retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analysed by single cell RNA-Sequencing at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters, five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types, namely retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone and rod photoreceptors and Müller glia cells. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and those involved in retinal homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs, formation of a distinct RPE cluster, the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors and an increasing number of Müller Glia cells over time. The pseudotime analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development, with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of Müller glia being the latest. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of single cell RNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of the organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.	A hESC (H9) cell line harbouring a CRX-GFP reporter was differentiated to retinal organoids 25. Samples were collected at 60, 90 and 200 days, dissociated, partitioned into single cells using the Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell mRNA-Seq HT IFC and processed for scRNA-Seq.

GSE119320	SRP159246	The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue/S, green/M and red/L cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism controlling S vs. L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone-degrading and activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.	EP1 iPSC-derived organoids were analyzed at time points ranging from day 10 to day 250 of differentiation. We took samples at day 10 (n=3), day 20 (n=2), day 35 (n=3), day 69 (n=3), day 111 (n=3), day 128 (n=3), day 158 (n=2), day 173 (n=3), day 181 (n=3), day 200 (n=3), and day 250 7 (n=3). RNA from individual organoids was extracted using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Individual libraries were prepared for each sample using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single 200 bp reads.

GSE115404	SRP149898	Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey the major output of information collected from the eye to the brain. Thirty subtypes of RGCs have been identified to date. Here, we analyze 6,225 RGCs (average of 5,000 genes per cell) from right and left eyes by single cell RNA-seq and classify them into 40 subtypes using clustering algorithms. We identify additional subtypes and markers, as well as transcription factors predicted to cooperate in specifying RGC subtypes. Zic1, a marker of the right eye-enriched subtype, is validated by immunostaining in situ. Runx1 and Fst, the markers of other subtypes, are validated in purified RGCs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunostaining. We show the extent of gene expression variability needed for subtype segregation, and we show a hierarchy in diversification from a cell type population to subtypes. Finally, we present a website for comparing the gene expression of RGC subtypes.

GSE107618	SRP125998	The developmental pathway of the neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been revealed by extensive research in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the human NR and RPE, as well as the interactions between these two tissues, have not been well defined. Here, we analyzed 2,421 individual cells from human fetal NR and RPE using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique and revealed the tightly regulated spatiotemporal gene expression network of human retinal cells. We identified major cell classes of human fetal retina and potential crucial transcription factors for each cell class. We dissected the dynamic expression patterns of visual cycle and ligand-receptor interaction related genes in the RPE and NR. Moreover, we provided a map of disease-related genes for human fetal retinal cells and highlighted the importance of retinal progenitor cells as potential targets of inherited retinal diseases. Our findings captured the key in vivo features of the development of the human NR and RPE and offered insightful clues for further functional studies.

GSE125708	SRP182592	The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is capable of tolerating chronic hypoxia, but cell type-specific responses to this stress have not been systematically characterized.  In the Norrin-knockout (NdpKO) mouse, a model of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), developmental hypovascularization of the retina produces chronic hypoxia of inner nuclear layer (INL) neurons and Muller glia.  We have used single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metabolite labeling from 13C-glucose to compare wild type and NdpKO retinas.  In NdpKO retinas, we observe gene expression responses consistent with hypoxia in Muller glia and retinal neurons, and we find a metabolic shift that combines reduced flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle with increased synthesis of serine, glycine, and glutathione.  We also used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the responses of individual cell types in NdpKO retinas to those in the hypoxic cerebral cortex of mice that were housed for one week in a reduced oxygen environment (7.5% oxygen).  In the hypoxic cerebral cortex, glial transcriptome responses most closely resemble the response of Muller glia in the NdpKO retina.  In both retina and brain, vascular endothelial cells activate a previously dormant tip cell gene expression program, which likely underlies the adaptive neo-angiogenic response to chronic hypoxia.  These analyses of retina and brain transcriptomes at single-cell resolution reveal both shared and cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in response to chronic hypoxia, implying both shared and distinct cell type-specific physiologic responses.

GSE142526	SRP238587	To study the development of human retina, we used single cell RNAseq at key fetal stages and followed the development of the major cell types, as well as populations of transitional cells. We also analyzed stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids; although organoids have a very similar cellular composition at equivalent ages to the fetal retina, there are some differences in gene expression of particular cell types. Moreover, the inner retinal lamination is disrupted in more advanced stages of organoids when compared with fetal retina. To determine whether the disorganization in the inner retina was due to the culture conditions, we analyzed retinal development in fetal retina maintained under similar conditions. These retinospheres develop for at least 6 months, displaying better inner retinal lamination than retinal organoids. Our scRNAseq comparisons between fetal retina, retinal organoids and retinospheres provide a new resource for developing better in vitro models for retinal disease.

GSE149100	SRP257883	Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify cell specific expression patterns from infant and aged choroid, with a particular emphasis on how endothelial gene expression changes with age. Methods: Independent libraries were prepared for infant and adult choroidal cells from four human donors. Macular and peripheral samples from single-cell donors 18-21 were acquired, analyzed, and uploaded in a previous experiment (GSE135922). In single-cell donors 22-25, new reads were acquired from a 12-mm macula-centered punch. Choroidal punches gently dissociated in collagenase II for 1 hours before cryopreservation. Thawed cells were enriched endothelial cells by incubating with anti-CD31-microbeads. Both CD31-positive and CD31-negative libraries from single-cell donors 22-25 were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq system. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome build hg19 with CellRanger(v3.0.1) and filtered to remove cells likely to be doublets or cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial reads. Libraries from single-cell donors 22-25 were aggregated with donors 18-21 using canonical correlation analysis. Feature selection was performed with the variance stabilizing transformation before integration was performed with Seurat (v3.0.1). Results: A total of 37,070 cells were recovered after filtering with 415,740,738 corresponding reads. A total of 17,229 cells were recovered from infant libraries while 19,841 cells were recovered from the adult libraries. Clusters were assigned to known choroidal cell types based on expression of distinguishing marker genes. Differential expression analysis identified genes enriched in each population of cells originating from infant versus adult libraries.

GSE133382	SRP212151	Neuronal types in the central nervous system differ dramatically in their resilience to injury or insults. Here we studied selective resilience in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ~80% of RGCs in 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 45 RGC types in adult retina. We tracked their survival after ONC, characterized transcriptomic, morphological, and physiological changes that preceded degeneration, and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury, and demonstrates that these responses can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention	In this experiment, we FACS sorted for retinal ganglion cells using a combination of a transgenic reporter (VGLUT2) and a surface protein CD90 from dissociated cells from retinas of adult (postnatal day 56) mice	Tran NM, Shekhar K, Whitney IE, Jacobi A et al.

GSE148077	SRP255195	Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of ~85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral reti-na of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal gangli-on and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal re-gions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding dis-eases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Fi-nally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and pro-vide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual pro-cessing.	To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease. We dissected fovea (~1.5 mm diameter centered on the foveal pit, which was visible under a dissecting microscope) and peripheral samples (> 5 mm from the fovea) from whole retina, pooling peripheral pieces from all four quadrants. Foveal samples were dissociated into single cells, which were profiled without further processing using high-throughput droplet sequencing. For peripheral samples, in which rod photoreceptors and RGC comprise ~80% and <2 % of total cells respectively, we depleted rods using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD73 or enriched RGCs using anti-CD90-conjugated beads prior to collection , using protocols established in our study on macaque retina.

GSE122970	SRP170761	The development of single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed high resolution analysis of cell type diversity and transcriptional networks controlling cell fate specification. To identify the transcriptional networks governing human retinal development, we performed scRNA-Seq over retinal organoid and in vivo retinal development, across 20 timepoints. Using both pseudotemporal and cross-species analyses, we examined the conservation of gene expression across retinal progenitor maturation and specification of all seven major retinal cell types. Furthermore, we examined gene expression differences between developing macula and periphery and between two distinct populations of horizontal cells. We also identify both shared and species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development. Finally, we identify an unexpected role for ATOH7 expression in regulation of photoreceptor specification during late retinogenesis. These results provide a roadmap to future studies of human retinal development, and may help guide the design of cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.

GSE132229	SRP200499	Autoimmune uveoretinitis is a significant cause of visual loss, and mouse models offer unique opportunities to study its disease mechanisms. Aire-/- mice fail to express self-antigens in the thymus, exhibit reduced central tolerance, and develop a spontaneous, chronic, and progressive uveoretinitis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we characterized wild type and Aire-/- retinas to define, in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, the cell populations and gene expression patterns associated with disease. Based on scRNA-seq, immunostaining, and in situ hybridization, we infer that (i) the dominant effector response in Aire-/- retinas is Th1-driven, (ii) a subset of monocytes convert to either a macrophage/microglia state or a dendritic cell state, (iii) the development of tertiary lymphoid structures constitutes part of the Aire-/- retinal phenotype, (iv) all major resident retinal cell types respond to Interferon gamma by changing their patterns of gene expression, and (v) Muller glia up-regulate specific genes in response to Interferon gamma and may act as antigen presenting cells.

GSE159107	SRP286543	Retinal structure and function have been studied in many vertebrate orders, but molecular characterization has been largely confined to mammals. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. From ~40000 single cell transcriptomes, we identified ~150 cell types distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates – photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and glial cells. To match molecular profiles to morphology, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mice and primate retinal cell types. Taken together, our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.	We used scRNA-seq to profile cells from the chick retina. From ~40,000 single cell transcriptomes, we identified cells of all 6 classes named above (PR, HC, BC, AC, RGC and glia) and used unsupervised methods to divide them into ~150 clusters. We show that 136 of the groups represent putative cell types, with others corresponding to developmental intermediates. We then devised a method for CRISPR-based somatic cell integration of fluorescent reporters into genes shown by scRNA-seq to be expressed by specific types. Using this technique along with other histological methods, we matched molecular profiles to morphology for many neuronal types. We also found a positional signature in Müller glia, with distinct expression patterns based on their location along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and central-peripheral retinal axes. Finally, we compared the cell classes and types of chick retina with those of three mammalian species – mouse, macaque and human – demonstrating conserved molecular features of all classes and some types, along with multiple differences between chick and mammals. Together, our results provide new insights into retinal structure and evolution generally, as well as a foundation for anatomical, physiological, and developmental studies of avian retina.

GSE142244	SRP238072	Development of the vertebrate eye, like many developmental systems, depends on genes that are used iteratively in multiple distinct processes. The OTX2 transcription factor is one such gene, with a requirement for eye formation, photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium specification, among others. During the time period of retinal fate choice, OTX2 is expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells with restricted fate choices. However, given the multiple roles for OTX2 and limitations of conventional conditional knockout strategies, the functional significance of its expression is unknown. The present study reports the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to produce somatic mutations of OTX2 in the chick retina, and identifies similar phenotypes to those observed in human patients. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing was used to determine the functional consequences of OTX2 gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 on the population of cells derived from OTX2-expressing retinal progenitor cells. This not only confirms that OTX2 is required for the generation of photoreceptors, but also for maintaining the proliferative potential of cells and suppressing the formation of specific retinal fates. These include specific subtypes of retinal ganglion and horizontal cells, suggesting that in this context OTX2 functions to repress sister cell fate choices. Upregulation of key transcription factors involved in the formation of these cells was observed suggesting that OTX2 is upstream of critical nodes of gene regulatory networks of these alternative fates.	10x-based single cell RNA sequencing from retinal cells electroporated at E5 and cultured in explant form for 48h.

GSE159929	SRP292721	Background: As core units of organ tissues, cells of various types play their harmonious rhythms to maintain the homeostasis of the human body. It is essential to identify the characteristics of cells in human organs and their regulatory networks for understanding the biological mechanisms related to health and disease. However, a systematic and comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile across multiple organs of a normal human adult is missing. Results: We perform single-cell transcriptomes of 84,363 cells derived from 15 tissue organs of one adult donor and generate an adult human cell atlas. The adult human cell atlas depicts 252 subtypes of cells, including major cell types such as T, B, myeloid, epithelial, and stromal cells, as well as novel COCH+ fibroblasts and FibSmo cells, each of which is distinguished by multiple marker genes and transcriptional profiles. These collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of major human organs. Moreover, T cell and B cell receptor repertoire comparisons and trajectory analyses reveal direct clonal sharing of T and B cells with various developmental states among different tissues. Furthermore, novel cell markers, transcription factors and ligand-receptor pairs are identified with potential functional regulations in maintaining the homeostasis of human cells among tissues. Conclusions: The adult human cell atlas reveals the inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity of cell characteristics and provides a useful resource in uncovering key events during the development of human diseases in the context of the heterogeneity of cells and organs.

GSE168704	SRP310237	The choroid plexus (ChP) in each brain ventricle produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forms the blood-CSF barrier. We apply single cell and single nuclei sequencing to identify region and age specific shifts in gene expression of the constituent cell types of the choroid plexus. First, we sequenced whole cells (15,620) from each ventricle (lateral, third and fourth) of the embryonic mouse brain (Embryonic day (E) 16.5). Our analyses and validation of gene (smFISH) and protein (immunohistochemistry) expression combined with spatial mapping (confocal imaging) revealed the identity and location of major cell types, subtypes, proliferating cells, progenitor populations and regionalized gene expression, across each ventricle in the developing brain. Next, to track age-dependent shifts in the choroid plexus properties, we performed single nuclei sequencing (83,040) across each ventricle of the embryonic (E16.5), adult (4 months) and aging (20 months) mouse brain. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells showed regionalized gene expression patterns by ventricle, starting at embryonic stages and persisting with age. Dramatic transcriptional shifts were found with maturation (embryonic to adult) and a smaller shift within each aged cell type. With aging, epithelial cells upregulated host defense programs and resident macrophages enhanced expression of IL-1b signaling genes. Our atlas revealed ChP brain barrier cellular diversity, architecture and signaling across ventricles during development, maturation and aging.
